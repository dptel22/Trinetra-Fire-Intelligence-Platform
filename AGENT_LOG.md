# Agent Activity & Contract Reconciliation Log

Protocol: Every agent appends — never edits past entries — to `AGENT_LOG.md` at repo root, one entry per unit of work.

**Scope:** Step 1 — Reconcile 52 vs. 55 feature drift and inference bundle artifacts between Sept 2 coordination doc and v3 training run.
**Files touched:**
- `docs/backend-rebuild-coordination.md`
- `AGENT_LOG.md`
**What you did:**
- Traced the 3 added features (`acq_month`, `doy_sin`, `doy_cos`) to `Cat boost training notebook` (cell 2 / cell 6) and `models/PS26162_catboost_final/model_metadata.json` (lines 82-84).
- Confirmed the 2026-09-07 training run upgraded dataset shape from `(1442545, 58)` to `(1442545, 61)` by incorporating the 3 cyclical calendar features from `data-eda.ipynb` Phase 8C.
- Verified that `CAT_FEATURES = ["h3_08", "daynight"]` in `app/core/config.py:13` is strictly aligned with the model's native categorical indices and the bundle's `feature_schema.json:60-61`.
- Appended the "Reconciled Final Contract Log (2026-09-08)" to `docs/backend-rebuild-coordination.md`.
**Verification run:**
- Python test suite: `pytest -v` -> 24 passed in 7.82s.
- Parity assertion: `tests/test_backend.py::test_calendar_feature_parity_sql_vs_pandas` PASSED.
**Contradicts or supersedes:**
- Supersedes `docs/backend-rebuild-coordination.md` Sections 1.14, 2.29, and Agent A/B logs which documented a 52-feature contract and model path `models/catboost_hotspot_classifier_v1.cbm`. The live locked contract is 55 features and model path `models/PS26162_catboost_final/inference_bundle/catboost_hotspot_classifier.cbm`.
**Open items handed off:**
- Step 2 (model manifest creation) and Step 3 (training/serving skew test across all 55 features against real parquet row).
